If you are frustrated on how to download the whole directory directly from GitHub, I recommend a tool for you!!!

That is called [**Refined GitHub**](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github). It is a great browser extension that makes GitHub even more awesome!

After installing the extension, you can go to the folder you want to download and click the three dots on the top right corner. Then smash the *Download Directory* button! But unfortunately, it only works for public repo only.
